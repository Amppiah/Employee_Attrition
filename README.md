# Employee_Attrition 
The data is an excel document of almost 1500 entrie of employees.
It consists of employee identification, their income, their age, departments among other variables .
The data is an HR complilation of employees who left the company and those who stayed . I created a 
working sheet to be used for my data cleaning . 
I checked for :
-duplicates
-Trimmed the education column to get rid of spaces after I changed the data from numbers to strings
- Converted the age columns into groups to aid in my visualisation .

I then created another sheet for the pivot tables to help me visualize the data i wanted . I utilised 
gender column, age Bracket, attrtion, monthly income, education, job satisfaction, department, 
maritalstatus, and job roles .
The analysis provides insight on the number of male and females who have left the company, the average 
income of females and males, the employees experiencing maximum job satifaction or not , the various job
roles that have lost the most employee and also a distribution of femails and females.
Included is the slicer feature which will helpin filtering the visualise and provide particular information .
